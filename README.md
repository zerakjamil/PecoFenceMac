# PecoFenceMac

Native macOS port of [DayuanJiang/PecoFence](https://github.com/DayuanJiang/PecoFence).
AppKit desktop panels and SwiftUI settings share the original Rust rule engine,
configuration format, snapshots, and backups.

- Group files without moving their originals; browse live folder portals.
- Click a title bar to expand or collapse. Expanding pushes lower fences down;
  collapsing closes contiguous stacks. Double-click the name to rename.
- Move and resize panels, switch icon/list views, and lock settled positions.
- Route Desktop files by extension, save layouts, and import/export configuration.
- Use **⌘⌥Space** for Peek, **Esc** to return, and the bundled JSON CLI for scripts.
- Choose System, Light, or Dark appearance across panels and settings.
- Open project folders in Terminal, VS Code, Xcode, or a chosen app from context menus.
- Preview with Space, navigate with arrows, and copy files with Command-C.
- Show local Git branch/change counts in portal footers; optionally hide build folders.
- Save project workspaces, switch with **⌘⌥[ / ⌘⌥]**, and restore matching layouts when displays reconnect.
- Enable **Snap reordering** to insert a dragged fence into another stack; disable it for free movement.

Requires macOS 14+, Xcode command-line tools, and Rust stable. Tested on Apple
Silicon with macOS 26.5.1.

```sh
bash scripts/build-macos.sh
open "$HOME/Library/Caches/PecoFence/build/PecoFence.app"
```

#Optional Desktop cleanup hides fenced originals in Finder while retaining their
locations. First-click controls and short coordinated folding animations keep
common actions quick. See [Mac usage](macos/README.md) for settings and shortcuts.

**Original creator: [DayuanJiang](https://github.com/DayuanJiang).**
PecoFenceMac is derived from [PecoFence](https://github.com/DayuanJiang/PecoFence),
created by DayuanJiang and its contributors. The original Rust core provides the
data model, rule engine, snapshots, and configuration backups. This repository
adds the macOS shell and developer tools. Original Apache 2.0 license and notices
are retained; credit for the original project remains with its authors.

Apache 2.0. Original Windows source and notices are retained. The Mac port does
not yet implement every upstream feature; see the linked limitations.

## Your desktop. Configured by your AI

**Built-in CLI. Ready for your AI agent.**

Tell your AI agent how you want your desktop to work. The bundled `pecofence-cli` lets Claude Code, Codex and Cursor read your current setup and apply changes directly in PecoFence.

- **Configure it in your own words.** Change themes, transparency, icon sizes and global settings, or adjust every fence at once.
- **Organize once. Keep it organized.** Create project fences, arrange icons and add rules that sort new files automatically.
- **Save a setup you like.** Use snapshots for fence layouts and configuration export/import for settings, rules and layouts.

**Try it with your AI agent**

Open PecoFence, then paste this request into your AI coding agent:

> Use pecofence-cli to configure my desktop. First read pecofence-cli skill and pecofence-cli describe, then inspect my current settings and fences. Back up my configuration before changes. Switch to dark mode and make all fences more transparent.

The CLI is included. The Microsoft Store edition adds `pecofence-cli` to PATH. With the portable ZIP, give your agent the path to `pecofence-cli.exe`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Example conversation with a coding agent</strong></summary>

> Put my desktop PDFs in a Docs fence, keep new PDFs there, switch to dark mode and make the fences more transparent.

```powershell
pecofence-cli config export "$env:USERPROFILE\pecofence-before-ai.json"
pecofence-cli snapshot save before-cleanup
pecofence-cli fence create --title Docs
pecofence-cli rule add --name PDFs --ext pdf --to Docs --index 0
pecofence-cli rule apply
pecofence-cli settings set theme dark
pecofence-cli fence set --all opacity clear
```

</details>

Built for agents and scripts: `describe` exposes the command catalog and JSON Schemas; `skill` prints the agent guide. JSON results report what changed, and structured application errors help the agent choose its next step.

## Give everything a place

Projects, screenshots, things to read later—keep them in their own groups, arranged
the way you work. PecoFence adds just enough structure to make your desktop useful again.

</p>

| **Group your work** | **Keep folders close** | **Clear some space** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Make a fence for each project. Drag, resize and snap it into place. | Put a live folder on your desktop. Browse subfolders and see changes as they happen. | Double-click the desktop to hide your groups. Double-click again to bring them back. |

## See it in action

### One window. Multiple workspaces.

Keep related groups together as tabs. Switch from Work to Art in a click,
then drag a tab out when you want the extra room.

![Switching between Work and Art, then detaching a tab into its own fence.](docs/assets/tabs.gif)

### Your desktop, one shortcut away.

Press **Ctrl + Alt + Space** to bring your fences above the current application.
Grab what you need, then press **Esc** to return.

## Small details, better everyday use

| Experience | What you get |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AI + CLI** | `pecofence-cli` — **Configure it in your own words.** Change themes, transparency, icon sizes and global settings, or adjust every fence at once. |
| **Less sorting** | Rules for file types, extensions, names, wildcards, shortcut targets, time and size. New files find their group automatically. |
| **Glass that fits your desktop** | Fluent and Liquid Glass themes, light/dark modes, per-fence colors, opacity and icon tinting. |
| **Familiar file handling** | Explorer context menus, drag and drop, copy/paste, multi-select, thumbnails and icon/list/details views. |
| **Space when you need it** | Roll a fence up to its title. Hover to expand. Lock a layout you like. |
| **A way back** | Layout snapshots, daily backups, configuration import/export and display swapping. |
| **A small footprint** | A native Rust application; the WebView2 settings panel loads on demand. |

Automatic organizing rules keep files in their original locations. File moves you
initiate work like they do in Explorer.

## Get PecoFence

<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9MV6WG3XNWSX?mode=direct"><img src="https://get.microsoft.com/images/en-us%20dark.svg" alt="Get it from Microsoft Store" width="200"></a>

The Microsoft Store edition is signed by Microsoft, updates automatically and never shows a SmartScreen prompt. Prefer a plain ZIP? The portable build below is the same app.

1. Open this repository's **Releases** page and download `pecofence-<version>-x64.zip`.
2. Extract the **whole ZIP** into a folder and run `pecofence.exe`.
3. Start organizing. Right-click the tray icon whenever you need Settings or want to exit.

Prefer a package manager? `winget install DayuanJiang.PecoFence` installs the same portable build and skips the SmartScreen prompt.

**Windows 11 x64 · Portable ZIP · No account required · Apache 2.0 licensed**

The first launch creates Programs, Folders, Files and documents, and Desktop groups
in your selected language. Windows desktop icons are restored when you exit.

<details>
<summary><strong>Requirements, configuration and a few useful notes</strong></summary>

- Designed for Windows 11 22H2 and later. Most native testing has been on 25H2;
  the full older-version and multi-display hardware matrix is still in progress.
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime is required for Settings. Keep the bundled
  `WebView2Loader.dll` and `pecofence-watchdog.exe` beside the app.
- Configuration lives in `%APPDATA%\PecoFence\config.json`. Launch with
  `--portable` to keep it in a `config` folder beside the executable.
- Existing installations keep their previous configuration directory.
  See the [upgrade guide](docs/UPGRADING.md).
- Glass uses the static desktop wallpaper. It does not refract other applications
  or live video wallpaper.
- Windows-owned dialogs and third-party Explorer menu entries follow Windows' language.
- Portable builds are unsigned. If Windows SmartScreen appears on first launch, choose
  **More info → Run anyway**. Installing from the Microsoft Store or through winget avoids the prompt.

## Build it. Make it yours.

PecoFence is Apache 2.0 licensed, and contributions are welcome—from a sharper translation
to a better desktop interaction.

[Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) · [Improve a translation](docs/LOCALIZATION.md) · [Development guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from source</strong></summary>

Install Rust stable and Visual Studio Build Tools with the C++ workload and Windows SDK.

```powershell
cargo build --locked --release
Copy-Item third_party/webview2/WebView2Loader.x64.dll target/release/WebView2Loader.dll
```

Create a distributable portable ZIP:

```powershell
./scripts/make-portable.ps1
```

The workspace is organized into `crates/` for the native app, `ui/` for Settings,
`locales/` for translations and `scripts/` for verification and packaging.
The product website lives in `site/`, and the optional video project in `extras/`
is independent of the app build.
